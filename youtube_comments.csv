I think I'll picture us, you with the waves
The ocean's colors on your face
I'll leave my heart with your air
So let me fly with you
Will you be forever with me?

My love will always stay by you
I'll keep it safe, so don't you worry a thing, I'll tell you I love you more
It's stuck with you forever, so promise you won't let it go
I'll trust the universe will always bring me to you

@Hallelujah333,"​To be honest, i never really had a good childhood. I experience depression many times, lust, and etc.. But guess what? HE STILL CARED FOR ME! EVEN YOU. HE LOVES YOU. He even saw me sinning, YET HE STILL FORGIVED ME. Please repent because it might be too late. LIFE CAN BE HARD, BUT HE'S STILL HERE TO HELP YOU. 
Listen. I do adultery when i was a child, cuz of worldly things. Then i experience depression on 7. Then i keep thinking about wrong things at 8 and 9. And..God helped me again. 
He gave me the happiness i never think i could have. I prayed, fasted. And he asnwered my prayers. 
He helped me on hard times
He gave me the ability, and talent i always prayed for. 

Yet i used the writing talent from God, the wrong way. 

Yet i keep covet, because the hobby He gave wasn't enough. 

Sometimes i can fail, and just want things other people have. Sometimes I'm not grateful. 

But He still helped me, again.

And that's His love for us. He saw you sin, yet still forgived us. We treated Him like a toy, and fail him. He already died on the cross for us. 

Yet we keep sinning. 

Please stop failling Him, people. We got the love we don't even deserve. He still helped us. 

Please. 

I repented many times, and sometimes i can fail. But that doesn't mean God will just leave you, because you sinned ""too much"", or whatever. He will try to help you, and you need to listen. Even though if there's ups, and down, i know we all can do it. We can do anything through God, everything is possible. 
Don't fall for the tricks from the devil. Don't do worldly things. Faith without works is dead. Repent before it's too late, because it might be too late. Don't focus when will salvation happened, instead, focus on God more. Fast, pray, do His commands. Trust, and it will happened. Anything compared to God's love, is nothing. He will help you if you're depressed. 

There's things that Christians should NOT say, for example ; i swear, i can't, what the -, bad words, mocking His name, oh my (-.) (God's name), saying His name in vain, judging people, lying, karma, lucky, etc. These are not allowed, and is breaking God's rules.
 Also as an Christian, we must be patient, care and love for each other, spread gospel, respect (other religion, people, parents, anything.), not jealous, and humble. [Going to church is important, it can help your faith. Because social as an Christian is pretty important. There's important things you might find out, that you didn't know from the Bible.] 
And even smallest things! Wait for people who's talking to complete what they're saying, helping someone who needed our help, invite someone to go to church. Don't be afraid to spread the gospel, i used to experience that, but it can save someone who needed His help. You can practice love, by helping your parents/doing their commands, pray for people who needs it ;  even your enemies. Doing these is the same as loving God. 

Don't let talents, electric things (phone, tv, whatever), lust / adultery, other god, and etc above God! I know it might be hard, but we need to stop. How? Pray to God to give the things you needed to stop doing the sins, ask Him to help you, and fast, and you can spend your free time spending with family, and fast. 

Don't make harsh jokes that might hurt someone, or dirty jokes, etc

Don't covet / don't be jealous. We need to learn to be grateful for what God have given us. 

Don't be greedy, spare for people who needed these. And it can hurt people too. 

Don't lie, spread rumors. We need to be careful by what we're gonna say

Careful with what we're seeing, saying, hearing, doing, or whatever. 

Be humble / don't do pride

Close the door when you're about to pray, or fast. 

Don't be addicted, or do adultery. Adultery is doing something dirty. Addicted can be about your electrical things, alcohol, dru*s, smoking. 

Be careful and don't try to say other god's name. And dont praise other god than Him. 

Don't kill innocent people

• Good deeds won't take you to heaven. •

Let God do the work sometimes

Don't believe in luck or karma

Don't lie. • It will not end good. •  Even if it hurts, it makes you closer to God. 

Don't be lazy. Don't sleep too much, don't play mobile too long. 

If you're sad, or feel like you're going to do something wrong. Immediately pray to God! Ask for help! 
Remember, we can't do things without God. Every asnwer to do things is God. We can't repent without His name. 
Please repent before it's too late. 
If you're sad, He's always here. 
If you're sick, may God heal you. 
• Please don't give up. Venting to God can help. Life  can be hard sometimes, and I'm sorry if you're struggling. •
He loves you no matter what. 
If you repent, He will forgive you. 
We need to let the past be the past, and change ourselves for God. 
Don't compare anyone, or even yourself. 
We all have worth
No one is perfect except God. 

We need His help

God bless you :) 

Spread the gospel, everyone. Don't be afraid. Because it might save someone.God bless everyone who's hurt, or needed His help. I hope they can recover in His name! ❤everyone please repent before it's too late and God loves you all btw and if you're sad pray to God!!",2025-02-04T10:25:12Z

Yet while I only heard a snippet of it, that was enough for me to actually finally search for this song this morning and I don’t regret it by any means. Not only did it make me tear up a little but it also made me feel a sense of awe. That in itself made this a song that I’ll definitely will enjoy listening to time and time again. Maybe it’s also especially because it reminds me a lot of my own amazing partner who I love so very much and how they make me feel. I hope I’ll be able to share this song with them at some point tbh. ♥️",2025-01-28T21:47:37Z

Слух мой ласкают сплетения слов.
Как незнакомцу, Вы кажетесь чудом!
В Вас заключаются тайны родов.

и в добродушно-миндальных глазах,
в щёчках, что тронуты свежим морозцем,

So let me fly with you
Will you be forever with me?

My love will always stay by you
I'll keep it safe, so don't you worry a thing
I'll tell you I love you more
It's stuck with you forever, so promise you won't let it go
I'll trust the universe will always bring me to you

@bhardwajprarthna,"Hey, yung kai is it your experience and you wrote it on your song?  Your voice and lyrics whole song is beautiful like spring sunshine. It's not perfect for too many but its really a masterpiece for way too many. For someone who is in love, who wants to be love it's really heartwarming and bright. It's shining and magical and very relaxing and calming. It's like a dream, a very bright and relaxing dream. It's warm. I thank you for sharing this warm but cool and beautiful song to the world. I hope everyone to love each other, be kind, a little kindness really means a lot. A little help without expecting, a little praise without jealously. A little hug without hate. Love more, It's like ocean it does not seek water but spread it. Hope everyone in this world get love, love each other, be happy, shine, smile and kind. Just like Guran and Jiang Jia, Zhang lurang and Su Zaizai, Gaun Fang and his grandma, everyone loves like this, stay healthy and happy. Yung Kai, I wish you all the happiness and love and great health. Love, Live and Shine. Not as your fan but as your fan and friend someone who think you are amazingly amazing.",2025-01-20T16:00:29Z

@Hallelujah333,"To be honest, i never really had a good childhood. I experience depression many times, lust, and etc.. But guess what? HE STILL CARED FOR ME! EVEN YOU. HE LOVES YOU. He even saw me sinning, YET HE STILL FORGIVED ME. PLEASE REPENT BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE. LIFE CAN BE HARD, BUT HE'S STILL HERE TO HELP YOU. 
Listen. I do adultery when i was a child, cuz of worldly things. Then i experience depression on 7. Then i keep thinking about wrong things at 8 and 9. And..God helped me again. 
He gave me the happiness i never think i could have. I prayed, fasted. And he asnwered my prayers. 
He helped me on hard times
He gave me the ability, and talent i always prayed for. 

Yet i used the writing talent from God, the wrong way. 

Yet i keep covet, because the hobby He gave wasn't enough. 

Sometimes i can fail, and just want things other people have. Sometimes I'm not grateful. 

But He still helped me, again.

And that's His love for us. He saw you sin, yet still forgived us. We treated Him like a toy, and fail him. He already died on the cross for us. 

Yet we keep sinning. 

Please stop failling Him, people. We got the love we don't even deserve. He still helped us. 

Please. 

I repented many times, and sometimes i can fail. But that doesn't mean God will just leave you, because you sinned ""too much"", or whatever. He will try to help you, and you need to listen. Even though if there's ups, and down, i know we all can do it. We can do anything through God, everything is possible. 
Don't fall for the tricks from the devil. Don't do worldly things. Faith without works is dead. Repent before it's too late, because it might be too late. Don't focus when will salvation happened, instead, focus on God more. Fast, pray, do His commands. Trust, and it will happened. Anything compared to God's love, is nothing. He will help you if you're depressed. 

There's things that Christians should NOT say, for example ; i swear, i can't, what the -, bad words, mocking His name, oh my (-.) (God's name), saying His name in vain, judging people, lying, karma, lucky, etc. These are not allowed, and is breaking God's rules.
 Also as an Christian, we must be patient, care and love for each other, spread gospel, respect (other religion, people, parents, anything.), not jealous, and humble. [Going to church is important, it can help your faith. Because social as an Christian is pretty important. There's important things you might find out, that you didn't know from the Bible.] 
And even smallest things! Wait for people who's talking to complete what they're saying, helping someone who needed our help, invite someone to go to church. Don't be afraid to spread the gospel, i used to experience that, but it can save someone who needed His help. You can practice love, by helping your parents/doing their commands, pray for people who needs it ;  even your enemies. Doing these is the same as loving God. 

Don't let talents, electric things (phone, tv, whatever), lust / adultery, other god, and etc above God! I know it might be hard, but we need to stop. How? Pray to God to give the things you needed to stop doing the sins, ask Him to help you, and fast, and you can spend your free time spending with family, and fast. 

Don't make harsh jokes that might hurt someone, or dirty jokes, etc

Don't covet / don't be jealous. We need to learn to be grateful for what God have given us. 

Don't be greedy, spare for people who needed these. And it can hurt people too. 

Don't lie, spread rumors. We need to be careful by what we're gonna say

Careful with what we're seeing, saying, hearing, doing, or whatever. 

Be humble / don't do pride

Close the door when you're about to pray, or fast. 

Don't be addicted, or do adultery. Adultery is doing something dirty. Addicted can be about your electrical things, alcohol, dru*s, smoking. 

Be careful and don't try to say other god's name. And dont praise other god than Him. 

Don't kill innocent people

• Good deeds won't take you to heaven. •

Let God do the work sometimes

Don't believe in luck or karma

Don't lie. • It will not end good. •  Even if it hurts, it makes you closer to God. 

Don't be lazy. Don't sleep too much, don't play mobile too long. 

If you're sad, or feel like you're going to do something wrong. Immediately pray to God! Ask for help! 
Remember, we can't do things without God. Every asnwer to do things is God. We can't repent without His name. 
Please repent before it's too late. 
If you're sad, He's always here. 
If you're sick, may God heal you. 
• Please don't give up. Venting to God can help. Life  can be hard sometimes, and I'm sorry if you're struggling. •
He loves you no matter what. 
If you repent, He will forgive you. 
We need to let the past be the past, and change ourselves for God. 
Don't compare anyone, or even yourself. 
We all have worth
No one is perfect except God. 

We need His help

God bless you :) 

Spread the gospel, everyone. Don't be afraid. Because it might save someone. 
 
God bless everyone who's hurt, or needed His help. I hope they can recover in His name! everyone please repent before it's too late and God loves you all btw and if you're sad pray to God!!",2025-01-17T08:45:49Z

I'll imagine we fell in love
I'll nap under moonlight skies with you
I think I'll picture us, you with the waves
The ocean's colors on your face
I'll leave my heart with your air
So let me fly with you
Will you be forever with me?

My love will always stay by you
I'll keep it safe, so don't you worry a thing, I'll tell you I love you more
It's stuck with you forever, so promise you won't let it go
I'll trust the universe will always bring me to you

@itazenin,"I love this song because it reminds me of long distance relationships. In the mv the girl is gone at the end of the video, but kai believes that the universe will somehow bring them back together.  

i placed this song in a playlist i made for my girl like how yung kai made this song and dedicated it to a crush he used to watch c-dramas with on discord...my girlfriend and i watch shows online while were apart physically. 

im meeting my girl for the first time next month and we've been dating long distance. 

pretty sure that its going to be a fun experience, but saying goodbye to her at the airport might make me cry.

I hope that after she goes back to new zealand we still stay together.",2025-01-16T08:20:22Z
